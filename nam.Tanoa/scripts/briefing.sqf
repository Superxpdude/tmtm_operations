player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Mission", "The remainder of the strike force (Echo Team) is currently located in the town of Vagalala, deep in Soviet territory; Soviet forces are closing in on their position.<br/>
Unfortunately, there's a mountain in between Echo Team and the response force. We can't go around the mountain, as heavy Soviet defenses are present on both the east and west sides; we'll have to go over the top.<br/>
Luckily for us, there's an old hiking path that goes right over the top and ends right at the south side of Vagalala. We're expecting to find enemy contact on the mountain itself; however, it's still a safer option than going around.<br/>
In addition to moving to rescue Echo Team, the response force is also tasked with eliminating a few key objectives within the area: four anti-air emplacements, and two ammo dumps.<br/><br/>
The strike force had 4 M113A3s and a single M163 VADS, all of which have been disabled within Vagalala. Reports indicate the vehicles are disabled, but not destroyed. If we were able to get an engineering team out there, we may be able to restore the vehicles to working condition.
This could prove useful for completing our objectives."]];
